    "ans - 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and understanding natural language. AI systems are designed to simulate human cognitive processes and solve problems through intelligent reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One example of AI is the use of chatbots to provide customer service in the banking industry. A chatbot can understand a customer's inquiry, extract relevant information, and provide a relevant response, all without human intervention. The chatbot can use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to improve its responses over time.\n",

    "2 . Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that refers to the use of algorithms and statistical models to allow computer systems to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task. In ML, the computer is trained on a dataset, and it uses this training to identify patterns in new data and make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A common example of ML is the use of a spam filter in email systems. A spam filter can be trained on a dataset of emails that have been marked as spam or not spam. The algorithm can use this training to identify patterns in new emails and classify them as either spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 . Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to extract complex features from data. DL is particularly effective at processing large, unstructured datasets such as images, video, and natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A popular example of DL is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition. CNNs can identify features such as edges and shapes in an image, and then use these features to classify the image into different categories, such as cats or dogs. DL techniques have also been used in natural language processing, such as for language translation or sentiment analysis."

    "ans - Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying data points that deviate significantly from the normal patterns in the data. Anomaly detection is a common application of unsupervised learning because it does not require labeled data, and anomalies are often rare and hard to find.\n",

    "3 - Clustering: The unsupervised learning algorithm is applied to cluster the data into groups of similar data points. The clustering algorithm can help in identifying the normal patterns in the data, and any data points that do not fit into any cluster can be considered as potential anomalies.\n",
