This type of statistics is used to provide an overview of the data and to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. Examples of descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (e.g. mean, median, mode), measures of variability (e.g. range, variance, standard deviation), and graphical representations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.\n",

    "Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics involve the use of statistical methods to make generalizations and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. This type of statistics is used to test hypotheses and to draw conclusions about the characteristics of a larger population based on a smaller sample. Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",

    "For example, if a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug, they might use inferential statistics to determine whether the drug is effective by comparing the results of a sample of patients who received the drug to a control group that did not receive the drug. They would use hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant difference in the outcomes between the two groups, and if so, infer that the drug is effective in treating the condition."

    "ans - Understanding the level of measurement is important when analyzing data because it determines the type of statistical analysis that can be used and the level of interpretation that can be made. Different statistical methods are appropriate for different levels of measurement, and using the wrong method can lead to inaccurate results and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a researcher wants to compare the salaries of employees in different departments of a company, they need to consider the level of measurement of the salary data. If the salary data is measured at the ratio level, the researcher can use statistical tests such as t-tests or ANOVA to compare the means and variances of the salaries between different departments. However, if the salary data is measured at the ordinal level, the researcher may need to use non-parametric tests such as the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the medians and distributions of the salaries between departments.\n",

    "Furthermore, the level of measurement also affects the level of interpretation of the results. For example, if a researcher finds a statistically significant difference in the mean salary between two departments, they can conclude that the difference is meaningful if the data is measured at the ratio level. However, if the data is measured at the nominal level, the researcher can only conclude that there is a difference in the frequency of salaries between the departments, but cannot make any meaningful statements about the magnitude of the difference.\n",
