    "ans - Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. It was developed by Armin Ronacher. Flask’s framework is more explicit than Django’s framework and is also easier to learn because it has less base code to implement a simple web-Application. A Web-Application Framework or Web Framework is the collection of modules and libraries that helps the developer to write applications without writing the low-level codes such as protocols, thread management, etc. Flask is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine."

    "adventages of flask framework : -\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Scalable : Size is everything, and Flask’s status as a microframework means that you can use it to grow a tech project such as a web app incredibly quickly. If you want to make an app that starts small, but has the potential to grow quickly and in directions you haven’t completely worked out yet, then it’s an ideal choice. Its simplicity of use and few dependencies enable it to run smoothly even as it scales up and up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Flexible : This is the core feature of Flask, and one of its biggest advantages. To paraphrase one of the principles of the Zen of Python, simplicity is better than complexity, because it can be easily rearranged and moved around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is this helpful in terms of allowing your project to move in another direction easily, it also makes sure that the structure won’t collapse when a part is altered. The minimal nature of Flask and its aptitude for developing smaller web apps means that it’s even more flexible than Django itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Easy to negotiate : Like Django, being able to find your way around easily is key for allowing web developers to concentrate on just coding quickly, without getting bogged down. At its core, the microframework is easy to understand for web developers, not just saving them time and effort but also giving them more control over their code and what is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Lightweight : When we use this term in relation to a tool or framework, we’re talking about the design of it—there are few constituent parts that need to be assembled and reassembled, and it doesn’t rely on a large number of extensions to function. This design gives web developers a certain level of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 Flask also supports modular programming, which is where its functionality can be split into several interchangeable modules. Each module acts as an independent building block, which can execute one part of the functionality. Together this means that the whole constituent parts of the structure are flexible, moveable, and testable on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6 Documentation : Following the creator’s own theory that “nice documentation design makes you actually write documentation,” Flask users will find a healthy number of examples and tips arranged in a structured manner. This encourages developers to use the framework, as they can easily get introduced to the different aspects and capabilities of the tool. You’ll find the Flask documentation on their official website."
