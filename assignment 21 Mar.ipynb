    "ans - Both Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are techniques used in machine learning to transform categorical variables into numerical variables that can be used as inputs for models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between these techniques is that Ordinal Encoding assigns a numerical value to each category based on its order or rank, whereas Label Encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category without considering any order or rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a categorical variable \"color\" with three possible values: \"red,\" \"blue,\" and \"green.\" Ordinal Encoding would assign a numerical value to each category based on its order or rank, such as \"red\" = 1, \"blue\" = 2, and \"green\" = 3. Label Encoding, on the other hand, would assign a unique numerical value to each category without considering any order or rank, such as \"red\" = 1, \"blue\" = 2, and \"green\" = 3, or \"red\" = 0, \"blue\" = 1, and \"green\" = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Ordinal Encoding may be preferred over Label Encoding when there is an inherent order or rank among the categories. For example, in the case of the \"color\" variable, Ordinal Encoding may be preferred if there is a logical order or ranking among the colors, such as red being the lowest and green being the highest in terms of brightness. On the other hand, if there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories, such as in the case of \"fruit\" with categories \"apple,\" \"banana,\" and \"orange,\" Label Encoding may be preferred."

For multi-class categorical variables, one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding can be used. One-hot encoding creates a binary vector for each category, while ordinal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category based on its relative order or frequency in the dataset. In this case, we can use ordinal encoding, where \"High School\" is assigned a value of 0, \"Bachelor's\" is assigned a value of 1, \"Master's\" is assigned a value of 2, and \"PhD\" is assigned a value of 3.\n",
