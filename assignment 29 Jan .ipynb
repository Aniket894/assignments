    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python has robust support for object-oriented programming. You can define classes and create objects to encapsulate data and behavior, making it easier to manage and organize complex code.\n",

    "Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming concepts, such as higher-order functions, lambda functions, and the ability to treat functions as first-class objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative Programming: Python allows you to write code in an imperative style, where you specify a series of statements that are executed sequentially, often using control flow structures like loops and conditionals.\n",

    "ans - Memory management in Python is handled automatically through a combination of techniques, including reference counting and a garbage collector. Here's an overview of how memory management works in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference Counting: Python uses reference counting as its primary memory management technique. Each object in Python has a reference count, which is the number of references pointing to that object. When a new reference to an object is created, the reference count is incremented. Conversely, when a reference is deleted or goes out of scope, the reference count is decremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage Collection: In addition to reference counting, Python also employs a garbage collector to handle cyclic references. Cyclic references occur when objects reference each other in a way that forms a cycle, making them unreachable by regular reference counting. The garbage collector periodically identifies and collects such cyclically referenced objects, freeing up memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Memory Allocation: Python automatically manages the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects. When an object is created, memory is allocated for it. Python handles the deallocation of memory when an object is no longer referenced or when the program terminates. This automatic memory management eliminates the need for manual memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks and segmentation faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Optimization: Python provides memory optimization techniques to minimize memory consumption. For example, small integers and string literals are interned, meaning that multiple references to the same value point to the same memory location. This reduces the memory footprint by avoiding redundant storage of identical objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Management Functions: Python also offers several functions and modules to explicitly manage memory. The sys module provides functions like getsizeof() to obtain the size of objects in memory, and getrefcount() to get the reference count of an object. The gc module allows manual control over the garbage collector, enabling features like disabling or enabling automatic garbage collection, collecting garbage on demand, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's memory management is designed to be automatic and transparent to the developer. The combination of reference counting and garbage collection helps ensure efficient memory usage and frees developers from the burden of manual memory management, allowing them to focus on writing code."
