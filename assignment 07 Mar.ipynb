    "ans - For a normal distribution, the measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) are equal to each other. This is because a normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, which means that the median (the middle value) and the mode (the most frequently occurring value) are also equal to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship between the measures of central tendency is one of the characteristics that make the normal distribution useful in many statistical applications. It means that the mean, median, and mode can be used interchangeably as measures of central tendency in a normal distribution, and they will all provide the same information about the distribution's center.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also why the mean is often used as the default measure of central tendency in statistical analysis, because it is easy to calculate and provides a good estimate of the center of a normal distribution. However, in some cases, such as when the data is skewed or has outliers, the median or mode may be a more appropriate measure of central tendency.\n",

    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables are linearly related. It indicates the direction of the relationship between the variables (positive or negative) and its strength, but does not provide information on the magnitude of the relationship. Covariance can take on any value, positive, negative, or zero, depending on the relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure of the relationship between two variables. It takes into account the scale of the variables and provides a value between -1 and 1, where values close to -1 indicate a strong negative relationship, values close to 1 indicate a strong positive relationship, and values close to 0 indicate no relationship. Correlation also indicates the direction of the relationship between the variables, but it provides information on the strength of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, covariance provides information on the direction and strength of the relationship between two variables, while correlation additionally standardizes the values and provides information on the magnitude of the relationship. Correlation is a more commonly used measure of association because it can be more easily interpreted than covariance, and it is also more useful when comparing relationships between variables with different scales."

    "For measures of central tendency, outliers can cause the mean to be pulled towards their extreme value, while the median and mode may remain relatively unaffected.
