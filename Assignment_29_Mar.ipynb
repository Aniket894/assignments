    "ans - Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a linear regression technique that adds a regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. The primary difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression and OLS, lies in the type of regularization used.\n",

    "\n",

    "One notable feature of Lasso Regression is its ability to perform feature selection by driving some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "The L1 regularization term has a sparsity-inducing effect, favoring sparse solutions where only a subset of the features is deemed essential. This makes Lasso Regression particularly useful when dealing with datasets with many irrelevant or redundant features.\n",
    "Shrinkage Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero, similar to Ridge Regression. However, the key difference is that Lasso can lead to exact zeros for some coefficients, effectively excluding corresponding features from the model.\n",
    "This feature makes Lasso especially effective in situations where a subset of predictors is expected to be more relevant or when feature selection is desirable.\n",
    "Trade-off Between Bias and Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression involves a trade-off between bias and variance. The tuning parameter (often denoted as lambda or alpha) controls the strength of the regularization.\n",
    "As the tuning parameter increases, the regularization effect becomes stronger, and more coefficients are driven to zero, resulting in higher bias and lower variance.\n",
    "Application in High-Dimensional Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is particularly well-suited for high-dimensional datasets, where the number of features is large relative to the number of observations.\n",

In situations where the underlying relationship is highly non-linear, other methods specifically designed for non-linear problems might be more appropriate."

    "Information Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Information criteria, such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), can be used to assess the trade-off between model fit and complexity.\n",
    "Lower values of information criteria indicate better model performance.\n",
    "Plotting Regularization Path:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the regularization path, showing how the coefficients change for different values of lambda.\n",
    "Identify the point on the path where additional regularization leads to a significant decrease in performance, indicating an optimal lambda value.\n",
    "Nested Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more robust evaluation, consider using nested cross-validation. In nested cross-validation, an inner loop is used to optimize the regularization parameter, and an outer loop is used to assess the model's performance.\n",
    "This helps reduce the risk of overfitting the hyperparameter choice to a specific dataset split."
