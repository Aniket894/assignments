    "\n",
    "Precision: Precision is a measure of how many of the positively predicted instances are actually true positives. It quantifies the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. The precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP):\n",
    "Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "A high precision value indicates that the model has a low rate of false positives, meaning that when it predicts a positive instance, it is highly likely to be correct. Precision is useful when the cost of false positives is high, such as in medical diagnoses or spam email filtering, where false positives can lead to unnecessary treatments or important emails being classified as spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. It quantifies the ability of the model to find all the positive instances. Recall is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN):\n",
    "Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "A high recall value indicates that the model has a low rate of false negatives, meaning that it can successfully identify a large portion of the positive instances in the dataset. Recall is particularly important in situations where missing positive instances is more critical than having false positives. For example, in disease detection, missing a positive case can have severe consequences, so a high recall is desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that precision and recall are often inversely related. Improving one metric can lead to a decrease in the other. Therefore, the choice of which metric to prioritize depends on the specific problem and its associated costs and risks.\n",

    "To strike a balance between precision and recall, the F1 score is often used as a single metric that considers both values. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure of the model's performance. Other metrics, such as the precision-recall curve or the area under the curve (AUC), can also be used to evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall at different classification thresholds.\n"

The idea is to train a separate logistic regression model for each class, considering it as the positive class and the rest of the classes as the negative class.

The softmax function converts the raw output scores into probabilities that sum up to 1. During training, the model is optimized to minimize the cross-entropy loss, which measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the true class labels.
