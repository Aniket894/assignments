    "ans - Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used in linear regression to address multicollinearity and prevent overfitting.

This regularization term is added to the least squares objective function.\n",

    " The main difference between Ridge Regression and ordinary least squares regression lies in the regularization term. In Ridge Regression, the regularization term is proportional to the square of the L2 norm of the coefficient vector, while ordinary least squares regression does not include any regularization term. This addition of the regularization term in Ridge Regression helps to shrink the coefficients, especially when there are highly correlated predictor variables.\n",

    " The regularization term in Ridge Regression is controlled by a hyperparameter, usually denoted as alpha (α). A higher alpha leads to stronger regularization and more shrinkage of coefficients.

The assumptions of Ridge Regression are similar to those of linear regression, with the addition of an assumption related to the regularization term. Here are the key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: Ridge Regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. The model assumes that changes in the independent variables lead to proportional changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. There should be no systematic pattern in the residuals, and the error terms for one observation should not predict the error terms for another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be consistent throughout the range of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Perfect Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity among the independent variables. Perfect multicollinearity occurs when one independent variable is a perfect linear combination of others, making it impossible to estimate the individual coefficients.\n",

    "Normality of Errors (Not Strictly Required): While normality of errors is often assumed in classical linear regression, Ridge Regression is more robust and does not strictly require this assumption. However, normality can be beneficial for making statistical inferences.\n",

    "Ridge-specific Assumption - Regularization Parameter (λ): Ridge Regression assumes the appropriate choice of the regularization parameter (λ or alpha). The regularization term is added to the OLS objective function to control the extent of regularization. The value of λ should be chosen carefully to balance the bias-variance trade-off."
