In data science, data encoding is useful because it allows us to convert data into a format that can be easily analyzed and manipulated by computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in natural language processing, text data is encoded using methods such as one-hot encoding or word embedding. One-hot encoding represents each word as a binary vector where only one element is 1 and the rest are 0s. Word embedding, on the other hand, maps words to a high-dimensional vector space where similar words are located close to each other."

    "\n",
    "1 Standardization: Data encoding allows us to standardize data so that it can be processed and analyzed consistently. For example, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding ensures that each category is represented as a binary vector with the same length, regardless of the number of categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Feature extraction: Data encoding can be used to extract useful features from raw data. For example, word embedding can be used to extract meaningful features from text data that can be used for classification or clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Compression: Data encoding can be used to compress data by representing it in a more compact form. For example, encoding images using JPEG compression can significantly reduce the amount of storage required to store the image without significantly affecting the quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Data integration: Data encoding can be used to integrate data from multiple sources by encoding them in a standardized format. This allows data from different sources to be easily combined and analyzed together."

We can create a nominal variable \"topping\" with three categories: \"pepperoni\", \"mushrooms\", and \"olives\", and use one-hot encoding to transform the variable into three binary variables. We can then use these variables as features in a machine learning model to predict which toppings a customer is likely to prefer based on their past orders or demographic data."

    "One-hot Encoding: After label encoding the categorical columns, I would apply one-hot encoding. One-hot encoding creates a binary variable for each unique category in a categorical variable. These binary variables indicate whether a specific category is present or not for each observation in the dataset.\n",
    "For example, after label encoding the contract type column, there are three unique categories - month-to-month, one year, and two years. I would apply one-hot encoding to create three new binary columns - one for each category. If an observation has a month-to-month contract type, the corresponding binary column would have a value of 1, and the other two binary columns would have a value of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge with original dataset: Finally, I would merge the label encoded and one-hot encoded columns with the original numerical columns (age, monthly charges, and tenure) to create a new dataset with all numerical data.\n",
